# ComputerCraft-Scripts
Lua scripts for programmable turtles and related amenities

Includes a set of libraries which aims to tackle the uninteresting minutiae of writing scripts in ComputerCraft, such as:

 - An [importer](https://github.com/SwiftsNamesake/ComputerCraft-Scripts/blob/master/programs/importer.lua)
 - [Functional programming primitives](https://github.com/SwiftsNamesake/ComputerCraft-Scripts/blob/master/programs/fp.lua)
 - [Vectors](https://github.com/SwiftsNamesake/ComputerCraft-Scripts/blob/master/programs/vectors.lua)
 - [Navigation](https://github.com/SwiftsNamesake/ComputerCraft-Scripts/blob/master/programs/navigation.lua)
 - [3D printing](https://github.com/SwiftsNamesake/ComputerCraft-Scripts/blob/master/programs/fp.lua) and [blueprints](https://github.com/SwiftsNamesake/ComputerCraft-Scripts/blob/master/blueprints)


I'm open to suggestions and collaborations.

CAVEAT
------
This is a personal project and has only ever been tested on my PC. Tread carefully.
The library APIs and scripts may change at any time.
